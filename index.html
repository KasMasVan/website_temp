"Hello World"


Hi, I'm KasMasVan, an incoming PhD student.
Previously, I was a master student at XXX where I studied commonsense reasoning.
Prior to that, I did my bacholor at XXX where I studied XXX.

Research Interest.
I study natural language processing, and am specifically interested in measuring and improving the reasoning abilities of large language models.
I am also interested in the general applications of large language models, especially using them to do real-world tasks, which requires the tool-using or other LLMs.
